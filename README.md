# Time complexity of algorithms

This is a Python application built using the PyQT6 framework to help visualize the time complexity of various algorithms. The user can choose from a variety of algorithms and input sizes to generate a graph displaying the time it takes for each algorithm to complete.

## Installation
To use this project, you must have Python 3.6 or later installed on your computer. You will also need to install the PyQT6 package. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

    pip install pyqt6
Once you have installed PyQT6, you can download the project files from the GitHub repository.

## Usage
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal:

    python main.py

This will open the main window of the application. From here, you can choose which algorithm you want to visualize and what input sizes to use. You can also adjust the parameters of the graph, such as the axis labels and the colors used.

Once you have selected your options, click the "Generate Graph" button to generate the graph. The graph will be displayed in a separate window, which you can resize and save as an image if you wish.
